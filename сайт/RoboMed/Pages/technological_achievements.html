1   <h2 class = "headform">Summary.</h2>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform">Robotic-assisted surgery and the overall use of robots in medicine signify a qualitatively new stage in the development of minimally invasive technologies and endovideosurgery, thanks to the high level of precision, functionality, and ergonomics provided by modern robotic systems. Robotic technologies improve the quality of diagnostic manipulations, enhance the outcomes of therapeutic procedures and surgical interventions, ultimately leading to improved prognosis and quality of life for patients, while also significantly expanding clinicians' capabilities. This review article presents the key historical milestones and prerequisites for the development of automation and robotic technologies used in various industries, from ancient times to the present. The history of robotic procedures in different medical fields is briefly outlined, with particular attention given to robotic-assisted surgery as one of the main platforms for the application of modern technologies. At present, it can confidently be said that medical robotics plays a very important role in the advancement of future surgery.</p>

8   <h2 class = "headform"> Xenex </h2>
<br>
<p class = "parform">Xenex Corp. is a company that specializes in disinfection technology. They have developed a range of robots that use ultraviolet light to disinfect surfaces in hospitals and other healthcare facilities. These robots have been deployed in over 500 hospitals worldwide and have been particularly useful in combating the spread of infections like MRSA and C. difficile. The Xenex robots are also being used in Italy, which has been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Xenex robots use pulsed xenon lamps to emit high-intensity UV-C light, which is effective in killing bacteria and viruses on surfaces. The Xenex robot is just one example of how robotics is being used in healthcare to improve patient outcomes and reduce the spread of infections.</p>
