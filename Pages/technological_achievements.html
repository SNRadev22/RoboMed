    <p class = "parform">Robotic-assisted surgery and the overall use of robots in medicine signify a qualitatively new stage in the development of minimally invasive technologies and endovideosurgery, thanks to the high level of precision, functionality, and ergonomics provided by modern robotic systems. Robotic technologies improve the quality of diagnostic manipulations, enhance the outcomes of therapeutic procedures and surgical interventions, ultimately leading to improved prognosis and quality of life for patients, while also significantly expanding clinicians' capabilities. This review article presents the key historical milestones and prerequisites for the development of automation and robotic technologies used in various industries, from ancient times to the present. The history of robotic procedures in different medical fields is briefly outlined, with particular attention given to robotic-assisted surgery as one of the main platforms for the application of modern technologies. At present, it can confidently be said that medical robotics plays a very important role in the advancement of future surgery.</p>

        <h2 class = "headform">Da Vinci surgical robot</h2>
        <br>
        <div class="img_possition_form">
    <br>
            <p class = "parform">The da Vinci robots is a revolutionary surgical robot developed by Intuitive Surgical. The model has been in use ever since its release in year 2000. The da Vinci robot is the most complex surgical device and the most famous surgical 
                robot. It generally resembles a surgical robot device like any other as it possesses the distinctive robotic arms and controller console. In order to carry out a proper demonstration of its capabilities, the robot was used to perform a 
                surgery on a grape. During the demonstrative surgery, the surgeon made a small incision on the outer layer of the grape and then stitched both sides of the cut together. The da Vinci surgical robot has been regarded as a proper display 
                of robotics in the medical field ever since.

            <p class = "parform">The CyberKnife System is the first and only entirely robotic radiotherapy device. Just like many other robots in the medical field, the CyberKnife is minimally-invasive and also highly precise. It works on the basic principle of
                radiotherapy, where high doses of radiation are applied to specific areas in order to shrink or kill the tumorous or cancerous tissue within. The CyberKnife takes it all a step further by combining robotics and image guidance in order
                to further improve its precision, thus reducing the radiation exposure of healthy tissue.
            It creates detailed 3D images of the area via the use of X-rays and CT scans. These images are then used to track the progression of the 
                developing tumor. The device resembles a large, maneuverable robotic arm that aligns itself perfectly with the targeted area. This reduces the possibility of error while applying radiation. Furthermore, it completely removes the necessity of having to 
                hold the patient in a specific posture with the purpose of retaining maxium precision which ordinary radiotherapeutic devices have.</p>

            <div    >
            <p class = "parform">The term "microbots" is generally used when refferring to robots smaller or within the size range of a few millimeters. As they are pretty small, microbots almost entirely rely on their numbers in order to be efficient in their job. 
                They are specifically designed to work on small objects and due to this key feature they have seen medical utilization in recent years. Those robots can even be remotely controlled by doctors. <br>
                Here are some of their most prominent applications:</p>
            <br>
             <ul class = "ulform">
                <li>Unclogging blood vessels. Sometimes, all that is needed to save someone's life is a little push;</li>
                <li>Targeted delivery of medicine throughout the body. Microbots can speed up the process of such ordinary tasks which can sometimes prove lifesaving;</li>
                <li>Microsurgery. Given the proper tuning, microbots can perform surgery on a microscopic scale, where larger and clunkier tools might end up being irrelevant.</li>
             </ul>
    <br>    

             <p class = "parform">The potential of such complicated robots is vastly unobserved, but what from little results we have from experiments, one thing is evident: microbots have a bright future ahead.</p>

    <br>
            <p class = "parform">The Versius surgical robot was created by UK start-up Cambridge Medical Robotics (CMR for short). As it walks the same footsteps that da Vinci does, it also further improves on it in multiple aspects, making it one of the main 
competitors to that system. Designed with the end-user's (the surgeon's) convenience taken into consideration, the device strives for removing existing barriers of robotic surgery. Versius resembles a set of seperate single robotic arm 
carts and an open console, in contrast to the standard set by the da Vinci surgical system. The lightweight robotic arms increase ease of transport and deployment. The overall dexterity of Versius makes it a more practical solution 
when it comes to portability. The ergonomic position and use of 3D glasses, provided by the open console, enable communication between team members - something which the other consoles lack. </p>

             <p class = "parform">Robotic prosthetics are artificial limbs, designed to replicate the function of missing or impaired ones. They generally resemble what a human limb would look like in terms of overall composition and structure. Robotic limbs can be 
                controlled in many different ways: some-simple; some-not. But the most remarkable one is through neuromuscular control. Prosthetics that are controlled via this principle read signals from nerves or muscles (sent from the brain) and 
                translate them into movements by activating different parts of the prosthetic.
            With the help of commercially available robotics like those, amputees are given a chance to live a proper life again after lacking a physical part of themselves. 
                Not to discredit the intelligent anatomists that are also responsible for it. </p>

<p class = "parform">Xenex Corp. is a company that specializes in disinfection technology. They have developed a range of robots that use ultraviolet light to disinfect surfaces in hospitals and other healthcare facilities. These robots have been deployed in over 500 hospitals worldwide and have been particularly useful in combating the spread of infections like MRSA and C. difficile. The Xenex robots are also being used in Italy, which has been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Xenex robots use pulsed xenon lamps to emit high-intensity UV-C light, which is effective in killing bacteria and viruses on surfaces. The Xenex robot is just one example of how robotics is being used in healthcare to improve patient outcomes and reduce the spread of infections.</p>
