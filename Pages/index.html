    <h2 class="mainH2">About the website</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="parform">The RoboMed website contains information about the utilization of robotics in medicine, its benefits, achievements and history. Here you will find authentic, valuable information on the matter. 
    The website consists of five pages: the Home page, the Applications page, the Technological achievements page, the History page and the Development possibilities page.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="mainH2">The "Application" page</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="parform">In the "application" page you can read about some applications of robotics in medicine. You will find out in which fields of medicine and how they come in handy. We have also presented to you different types of robots and robotic devices used in medicine and you can read about how they are helpful. Some of the devvices you will read about are the service robots, the surgical robots and the rehabilitation robots.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="mainH2">The "Technical achievements" page</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="parform">In the "technical achievements" page you can read about some of the best technical achievements of robotics in medicine. You will find out about 9 pioneer inventions and amazing technological discoveries in different fields of medicine like the da Vinci surgical system which is able to perform minimally invisive susgeries with inhumane percision, the CyberKnife system which is able to remove cancerous tissue without even invaising your body and even robotic prosthetics which are able to atleast partly replace your lost or impaired limbs.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="mainH2">The "History" page</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="parform">In the History page you can find general information about the not so short history of robotics and its utilization in the field of medicine. The page contains inforamtion specifically about some
    of the oldest models of robotic devices, some of which have set the structural foundations for the surgical robots of the modern day and a summary of the technological imrpovements made so far.</p>
