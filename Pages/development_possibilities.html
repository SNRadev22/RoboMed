    <h2 class = "headform">Development possibilities of robotics in medicine</h1>
    <br>
    <p class ="parform">While the future of robotics in medicine is still rather unclear, a conclusion can be drawn from the advancements made so far: the incorporation of robotics in the medical field will become more common. With factors such as the
        constant improvement of robotics (and overall technology), people's demand for medical services assisted by robots, and the rise of the market, such a thing is entirely irreversible. But, generally speaking, things will get more
        sophisticated, more convenient, more available, and overall better. Here are some future possibilities for the development of robotics in the medical field:</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class = "headform">The medical robot market</h2>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform">As mentioned previously, the robotics market is on the rise, as is the medical robot market, which is expected to reach a size of approximately 40 billion USD by 2030. That is almost four times the size it had in 2021.
        Here are some reasons as to why that might be:</p>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform">Medical robots are more efficient at performing laparoscopic procedures. As a result, there is rising demand for precise and proper laparoscopic operations that boost market growth. For instance, in March 2022, the Cleveland
        Clinic, a US-based nonprofit academic medical center, stated that over 13 million laparoscopic procedures have been performed globally every year and are projected to grow by 1% over the next five years.</p>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform">North America was the largest region in the medical robot market in 2021. Asia-Pacific is expected to be the fastest-growing region in the forecast period. The regions covered in the medical robot market report are Asia-Pacific, 
        Europe, North America, South America, the Middle East, and Africa.</p>

            <h2 class = "headform">Surgical robots</h2>
            <br>
            <p class = "parform">The future of surgical robots is still rather speculative, but here are some aspects of surgical robot devices that have increasing room for improvement due to the advancement of technology:</p>
            <br>
            <p class = "parform">Enhanced Precision, Dexterity, and compactibility: Future surgical robots are expected to offer even greater precision and dexterity than current systems. Advancements in robotics technology, such as improved sensors and actuators, may
                enable robots to perform intricate surgical tasks with increased accuracy and finer manipulation. Adding to this, future robots may also take an example from the Versius system, which displays results of greater dexterity due to its
                compact nature. This means that smaller robots might also make it onto the market as a more available alternative.</p>
            <br>
            <p class = "parform">Artificial Intelligence Integration: Surgical robots are expected to incorporate artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to augment decision-making and improve surgical outcomes. AI can analyze patient data and assist in preoperative
                planning, provide real-time guidance during procedures, and even automate certain aspects of surgery. AI-powered surgical robots may adapt and learn from past procedures, leading to continuously improving surgical techniques.</p>
            <br>
            <p class = "parform">Collaboration with Human Surgeons: Future surgical robots are expected to work collaboratively with human surgeons rather than replacing them. Surgeons will retain control and oversee the robotic systems, leveraging the robots'
                capabilities to enhance their own surgical skills and improve patient outcomes. The surgical robots of the future may also incorporate advanced haptic feedback mechanisms, providing surgeons with a sense of touch and force feedback
                during procedures. This can enhance the surgeon's perception and enable more precise tissue manipulation. Additionally, integrating sensory feedback, such as visual and auditory cues, could further improve the surgeon's situational
                awareness.</p>
            <br>
            <p class = "parform">Integration with Imaging and Visualization Technologies: Surgical robots are expected to be seamlessly integrated with advanced imaging and visualization technologies, such as real-time MRI or augmented reality. This integration can 
                provide surgeons with enhanced visualization of anatomical structures and aid in precise surgical navigation.</p>

    <p class = "parform">The future of rehabilitation robots will probably lean towards the general convenience and comfort of the patient, while also further improving the rehabilitation process with advanced technology. Here are some viable predictions for the
        paths that rehabilitation robots might take:</p>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform">Personalized and Adaptive Rehabilitation: Future rehabilitation robots are expected to provide personalized and adaptive therapy based on individual patient needs. Advanced sensors and AI algorithms can enable robots to assess the 
        patient's progress in real-time and adjust therapy parameters accordingly, optimizing the rehabilitation process.</p>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform">Wearable and Portable Robotics: Rehabilitation robots are likely to become more wearable and portable, allowing patients to engage in therapy both in clinical settings and at home. Lightweight and user-friendly devices can enhance 
        convenience and enable more frequent and consistent therapy sessions, promoting faster recovery and improved outcomes.</p>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform">Brain-Machine Interfaces: The integration of brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) with rehabilitation robots is anticipated to enable direct communication between the patient's brain and the robotic system. This can enhance the precision 
        and intuitiveness of controlling robotic limbs, allowing individuals with paralysis or limb loss to regain greater functionality.</p>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform">Robotics for Neurological Rehabilitation: There is an increasing focus on using robotics for neurological rehabilitation, such as stroke recovery or spinal cord injury rehabilitation. Future rehabilitation robots may target specific 
        neurological impairments and employ specialized therapies to promote neural plasticity and functional recovery.</p>
    <br>
