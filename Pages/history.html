    <h1 class = "headform">History of robotics in medicine</h1>
    <p class = "parform">Today, robotics in medicine continues to evolve rapidly. The integration of AI, machine learning, and advancements in sensing technologies holds promise for further enhancing robotic systems' capabilities, enabling safer and more 
        effective medical procedures. But what about the past? Let's take a look at the history of robotics in medicine through a wide eye. </p>
    <h2 class = "headform">Early Developments (1960-1980)</h2>
    <div class="img_possition_form">
        <p class="parform">
            The earliest attempts at medical robotics focused on telemanipulation systems, where surgeons controlled robotic arms remotely. In 1961, the first robot, called the Unimate, was introduced for 
            industrial use, laying the foundation for future advancements in robotics and eventually the further utilization of robotics in medicine. </p>

            <h2 class = "headform"> Robotic Surgical Systems (1980-1990)</h2>
            <p class="parform">
                In the 1980s, significant progress was made in robotic surgery. In 1985, the PUMA 560 robotic surgical arm was developed, which aided in performing precise neurosurgical procedures. 
                The 1990s saw the development of the da Vinci Surgical System, a robotic surgical platform that enhanced surgical capabilities with increased precision, smaller incisions, and improved dexterity.</p>

    <h2 class = "headform">Minimally Invasive Surgery (2000)</h2>
    <div class="img_possition_form">
        <p class="parform">
            The 2000s witnessed a surge in minimally invasive surgery using robotic systems. The da Vinci Surgical System gained popularity, enabling surgeons to perform complex procedures with reduced trauma,
            shorter recovery times and enhanced patient outcomes. </p>

            <h2 class = "headform">Image-Guided Robots (2000-2010)</h2> 
            <p class="parform">
                Robots integrated with real-time imaging technology, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), were introduced. These robots provided accurate guidance during procedures, 
                particularly in neurosurgery, allowing surgeons to navigate intricate anatomical structures more precisely.
                Rehabilitation and Assistive Robots
                Robotics expanded beyond surgical applications to assistive and rehabilitation purposes. Robotic exoskeletons and prosthetics were developed to aid individuals with mobility impairments,
                helping them regain motor functions and improve their quality of life. </p>

    <h2 class = "headform">Autonomous Systems and Artificial Intelligence (2010-present)</h2>
    <div class="img_possition_form">
        <p class="parform">
            Recent advancements have focused on developing autonomous robots and incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into medical robotics. AI algorithms allow robots to analyze 
            medical data, assist in diagnostics, and even perform certain tasks independently. Furthermore, the rise of surgical robots with tactile feedback systems enhances the surgeon's sense of touch, improving surgical precision in the 
            process. </p>
