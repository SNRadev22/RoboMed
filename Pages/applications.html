    <h1 class = "headform">Applications of robotics in medicine</h1>
   <br>
    <p class = "parform">Here, in this page, many of the applications of robotics in medicine are put on display through useful and unusual information about the different types of robots that medicine can benefit from.</p>
    <br>
    <!--<p class = "parform"> If you come across an unusual words, visit the Dictionary page by clicking on said word.</p>
            Once (IF) the dictionary page is made, link all unusual terms and words to it-->

    <br>
     
    <h2 class = "headform"> Service robots </h2>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform"> This type of robot is generally used for simpler tasks that are either repetitive and or dangerous. Service robots are usually autonomous or follow a set of commands, though some can be manned by people.
        While the typical service robots that are only good for moving objects are also used in hospitals, there are some which stand out from the majority due to the general hierarchy of priorities within the medical field.
        That's where the Zipline drones truly shine. Zipline International Inc. is an American company that designs, manufactures, and operates delivery drones. In recent years, those drones have been used to deliver medicine and even blood
        bags to hospitals within reach of their depot. Not only are they faster than most other ways of delivery, they are also cheaper to power. This makes them an excellent and efficient way to ensure people's lives the safety they need.</p>
    <br>

    <h2 class = "headform">Disinfection robots</h2>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform"> Robots can be made responsible for sanitizing facilities, eliminating the need for hospital staff to come into contact with potentially harmful pathogens. For example, there are robots for disinfecting hospital devices and equipment: a Xenex robot is able to disinfect a ward using pulsed xenon light in less than 20 minutes.</p>
    <br> 
    <h2 class = "headform">Companion robots</h2>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform"> Robots are able to play the role of companions and even pets. Analysts predict that emotional support robots will be in demand in the future.

        In hospital settings, robots assist patients, especially the elderly and children, by encouraging them and demonstrating how to perform certain movements, such as sitting and getting up from bed. They remind them to take medication or talk to those who are deprived of regular human contact (which is especially relevant in the context of a shortage of nurses and caregivers). Such robots are often designed to look like other people or animals. For example, the Paro robot, a robotic baby harp seal covered in soft white fur, exhibits many of the behaviors of a real pet. Its task is to evoke a positive emotional response in patients and speed up recovery.
        
        There are currently very few care and support robots, primarily because of their high cost. However, their number is expected to increase significantly over the next decade.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class = "headform">Tele-assistance</h2>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform"> Physicians use robots to help them examine and treat patients in rural or remote locations, giving them a “telepresence” in the room. Specialists can be on a call, via the robot, to answer questions, examine patients, and guide therapy from remote locations. The key features of these robotic devices include navigation capability within the ER and examiнинг the patients physically with sophisticated cameras. This can be especially useful when the doctor can't be in the room physically or when the patient is in a remote area. </p>
    <br>
    <h2 class = "headform">Surgical robots</h2>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform"> Surgical robots are the type of robots used to perform surgery. They are either controlled by a human or run autonomously. Generally speaking, surgical robots resemble a set of highly dexterous and precise robotic arms, attached to
        a base. Those that require human supervision also have a screen which monitors the surgical process and controllers that are used to move the robotic arms. 
    </p>
    <p class = "parform"> Surgeries accomplished by robots are also a lot safer due to the fact that the chances of infection are reduced significantly. This makes the rather high price of robotic surgical service all the more worth it.</p>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform">Robotic surgery may be used for a number of different procedures, such as: </p>
    <br>
    <ul class="ulform">
        <li>Coronary artery bypass;</li>
        <li>Cutting away cancer tissue;</li>
        <li>Gallbladder removal;</li>
        <li>Hip replacement;</li>
        <li>Hysterectomy;</li>
        <li>Total or partial kidney removal;</li>
        <li>Kidney transplant.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform">Since surgical robots are becoming more and more adaptable, it really isn't a matter of what they can do as much as it is of what they can't. Here are some circumstances under which a robotic surgery shouldn't be performed:
    </p>
    <br>
    <ul class = "ulform">
        <li>Certain cases of comorbidity;</li>
        <li>Emergency surgeries;</li>
        <li>Operating on a trauma patient.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform"> As it is pretty evident, some things are better left up to people.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class = "headform">Rehabilitation robots</h2>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform">Rehabilitation robots are robots used for assisting patients during their time in rehab and or lowering the time they spend there. 
        They are generally classified into two main categories, according to their mechanical structures: end-effector and exoskeleton robots.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class = "ulform">An end-effector device is connected to the patient at a distal segment where applied force changes the position of other joints.<p>
    <!--Here I reused the CSS class "ulform" (which stands for unordered list format) with this paragraph as I think it works well.-->
    <br>
    <p class = "parform">An exoskeleton is connected to several points on the patient and all the joints are moved in a particular direction.</p>
    <br>
    <p class = "ulform">For an example: If connected to the waist, the femur and the ankle (of both legs), the exoskeleton will have the ability to move the patient's legs.</p>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform">Rehabilitation robots have done a great service to bedridden patients. Proper muscle strength and joint health are crucial to adequate and effective movement. That's where rehabilitation robots come in place as the typical 
        bedridden patient may lose up to 3% of their total muscle mass each day they spend lying in bed, alongside their gradually stiffening joints.</p>
    <p class = "parform">Furthermore, many rehabilitation robots are also responsible for having helped or even taught disabled people how to walk and balance again.</p>
    <p class = "parform">The Innowalk Pro is great example of that.</p>
