    <h2 class = "headform">Surgical robots</h2>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform"> Surgical robots are the type of robots used to perform surgery. They are either controlled by a human or run autonomously. Generally speaking, surgical robots resemble a set of highly dexterous and precise robotic arms, attached to
        a base. Those that require human supervision also have a screen which monitors the surgical process and controllers that are used to move the robotic arms. 
    </p>
    <p class = "parform"> Surgeries accomplished by robots are also a lot safer due to the fact that the chances of infection are reduced significantly. This makes the rather high price of robotic surgical service all the more worth it.</p>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform">Robotic surgery may be used for a number of different procedures, such as: </p>
    <br>
    <ul class="ulform">
        <li>Coronary artery bypass;</li>
        <li>Cutting away cancer tissue;</li>
        <li>Gallbladder removal;</li>
        <li>Hip replacement;</li>
        <li>Hysterectomy;</li>
        <li>Total or partial kidney removal;</li>
        <li>Kidney transplant.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform">Since surgical robots are becoming more and more adaptable, it really isn't a matter of what they can do as much as it is of what they can't. Here are some circumstances under which a robotic surgery shouldn't be performed:
    </p>
    <br>
    <ul class = "ulform">
        <li>Certain cases of comorbidity;</li>
        <li>Emergency surgeries;</li>
        <li>Operating on a trauma patient.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform"> As it is pretty evident, some things are better left up to people.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class = "headform">Rehabilitation robots</h2>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform">Rehabilitation robots are robots used for assisting patients during their time in rehab and or lowering the time they spend there. 
        They are generally classified into two main categories, according to their mechanical structures: end-effector and exoskeleton robots.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p class = "ulform">An end-effector device is connected to the patient at a distal segment where applied force changes the position of other joints.<p>
    <!--Here I reused the CSS class "ulform" (which stands for unordered list format) with this paragraph as I think it works well.-->
    <br>
    <p class = "parform">An exoskeleton is connected to several points on the patient and all the joints are moved in a particular direction.</p>
    <br>
    <p class = "ulform">For an example: If connected to the waist, the femur and the ankle (of both legs), the exoskeleton will have the ability to move the patient's legs.</p>
    <br>
    <p class = "parform">Rehabilitation robots have done a great service to bedridden patients. Proper muscle strength and joint health are crucial to adequate and effective movement. That's where rehabilitation robots come in place as the typical 
        bedridden patient may lose up to 3% of their total muscle mass each day they spend lying in bed, alongside their gradually stiffening joints.</p>
    <p class = "parform">Furthermore, many rehabilitation robots are also responsible for having helped or even taught disabled people how to walk and balance again.</p>
    <p class = "parform">The Innowalk Pro is great example of that.</p>
